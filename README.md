### Hey there! Welcome to yogAI, developed in 2020 by Cristina Maillo.
I created yogAI inspired by various Machine Learning models for visual recognition I experimented with during my internship. This is my first Machine Learning model and my first attempt at Web Development. I have loved (almost) every second of this project and I have learnt more than I could have imagined. <br>YogAI uses <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/pose_estimation/overview" target="_blank">Pose.Net</a>, developed by Google’s TensorFlow, and <a href="https://ml5js.org/" target="_blank">ml5.js</a>, a JavaScript library for Machine Learning on the browser. Most of my learning was following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YPSwT06y_AEYTqIwbeam3y" target="_blank">The Coding Train’s</a> YouTube playlist on Pose Estimation.
